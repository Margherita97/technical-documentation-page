        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
          environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.</li>
